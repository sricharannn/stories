    <p>Hi! I am Sri Charan, currrently working in a Public Sector Bank in India. By November 2023,
        I will be completing 10 years of service in the Banking sector. Most of my service has been
        in the Loans and Advances department. In all my years of service in this sector, I have faced
        both good and bad, in the staff and the customers. I don't rate myself in the top tier, but yes,
        faced the worst type also. I won't say I am an avid reader, but have read some decent to
        best thrillers without which I would have driven to madness in this job.
    </p>
