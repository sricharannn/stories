    <h1 style = "text-align: center">A GRUELLING HOUR</h1>
    <p>This happened to me in my second branch</p>
    <p>Charan works in a Public Sector Bank in Hyderabad. His branch is one of the  four biggest branches in India as per volume of the business. Charan is the last  in hierarchy in a branch which is headed by a scale VI manager (there are VII  scales in a Public Sector Bank). His branch starts at 10:30 A.M. and ends when  the manager says so. According to the rule book the junior is not to handle the  strong room keys, but usually in Public Sector the junior ends up handling  them. In this case Charan handles the keys in that branch. </p>
    <p>It started like any regular day. He decided to reach the branch a little bit  earlier that day to complete a pending work assigned to him. By the time  Charan arrived at the branch at 9:10A.M., which is 20 minutes earlier than his  regular time, there already is a senior officer waiting at the main door. He  wished the senior officer good morning and proceeded to open the main door. As he didn’t want to be disturbed in the middle of the pending `work, Charan  decided to handover the keys to the senior officer</p> 
    <p>Charan opened the front zip of his bag where he usually places them and  casually groped in the bag. But his hands couldn’t get hold of the keys’ pouch  in the bag where he usually places it. He frantically searched the whole bag to  no avail. Beads of sweat started forming on his brows and above his lips. He  thought to himself very hard as to what could have happened to the keys. Just  a week back Charan came by the knowledge of what happens to an officer if he  lost the keys – Rs.94,000/- fine, two increments cut, charge sheet for the  negligence and no promotions for God knows how long. </p>
    <h4>9:15A.M</h4>
    <p>Charan started tracing his steps from yesterday night very carefully.  His next stop after the Bank was KFC. He treated himself to a nice little Zinger  burger meal and went back to his single room which is located some 4kms  odd from his branch. He was sure that in all the time he was in KFC he never  let the bag from his shoulder. In the room there is no chance of misplacing the  pouch. At that point of time Charan wished that he might have opened the bag  for something and the keys might have fallen out of the bag. Even during the  thought process, he knew that did not happen.</p>  
    <h4>9:20A.M</h4>
    <p>Charan gave the senior manager some reason to meet his brother  for a quick breakfast and promised him that he would return by 10:15A.M. He  left his bag and sprinted out of the branch, started his bike and raced towards  his room. Even as he raced towards his room, he knew that he wouldn’t find  the keys in his room. On the way Charan stopped at the KFC, but the store is  still closed. It took him 15 minutes in the traffic to reach his room. Praying to  God he searched the whole room, but to no avail. Suddenly Charan felt  positive that if he didn’t place the keys in his bag then they should be in his  draw and cursed himself for not searching his draw before racing out of the 
    branch. He told himself that everything is going to be okay and that he would  find the keys in the draw.</p>  
    <h4>9:45A.M</h4>
    <p>With this new found positive thought Charan started his bike and  raced towards his branch. By the time he reached the branch, all except the  branch manager and the other officer who needs to be present to open the  safe, are present in the branch. He breathed a sigh of relief and searched for  the keys in his draw. He was positive that the keys would be lying in the draw  and vowed to be careful next time. But he did not find the keys even in the  draw. He knew, his chances of locating the keys are bleak now. But Charan didn’t lose his cool as he still has the KFC to search.</p> 
    <h4>10:05A.M</h4>
    <p>He immediately grabbed his bag and hopped on his bike and  revved towards KFC. There he came to know that the store opens only at  11:00 A.M. But Charan’s branch starts at 10:30 A.M. in just twenty more  
    minutes. Charan lost all the hope. He doesn’t even know for sure if the keys  are in KFC or not. What would he answer the Branch Manager? He doesn’t  even know where he lost the keys. Charan cursed himself for being so  careless. His future seemed completely lost. He just stood there in front of KFC  with tears swelling up in his eyes. He decided to go to room and plan his next  course of action. Run away to home or commit SUICIDE!!! </p>
    <h4>10:10A.M</h4>
    <p>Charan didn’t even know how he reached his room in the heavy  traffic. It is 10:20 A.M now and he is not anywhere near locating the keys.  With tears in his eyes and hope in his heart he once again opened his bag and  searched for one last time. NOTHING. He can think of nothing. He knows that  running away to home means end of life as he knows and be completely  dependent on his parents. May be a police case for the loss of keys. These  thoughts are not at all helping Charan and in frustration he threw the bag  against the wall. Something black fell out of the bag. He cleared his tears and  to his utter astonishment the keys pouch lay there in front of his eyes.</p>
    <h4>10:25A.M</h4>
    <p>He literally flew towards the branch on his bike and entered the  branch just in the nick of time before the Branch manager.</p>  
    <p>Charan didn’t get any time to rejoice or even think about how happy or lucky  he was that day. But even today the thought of that ONE HOUR gives him the  creeps and chills.</p>
