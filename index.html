    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Here is a thing about thrillers. Even the bad thrillers makes you turn the pages quickly, sometimes,
        to know if we guessed the climax correctly, most of the times, to check if it is even worth our time. 
        With a reading experience of may be 30-40 books and an almost 10 years of banking experience behind me,
        I decided to write some stories or rather my experiences as stories, adding a bit of thrill element and a
        bit of fiction hoping against hope to make it your worthwhile.    
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of the stories will be from my banking experience, but occasionally I will try my hand in creating
        new stories. Please, be patient with me. As I am not a native English speaker, my English wouldn't be
        that good and in fact, I appeal to you to guide me in the correct direction wherever you felt that a
        better word or a better framing of sentence is required, which will enable me to be a better writer.
    </p>
    <p>I present you my stories below. I am starting with only a single story and based on your feedback and my
        free time in this stress-ridden job I will add more stories.<br /> Thanking You
